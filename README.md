# Flowbite Blazor Dashboard

The Flowbite Blazor Admin Dashboard is a free and open-source UI admin dashboard template. It is built with the components from Flowbite Blazor and based on the utility-first Tailwind CSS framework. The dashboard features charts, tables, widgets, CRUD layouts, modals, drawers, and more. It is designed to help developers quickly build applications using the newest UI/UX development technologies in the open-source area.
