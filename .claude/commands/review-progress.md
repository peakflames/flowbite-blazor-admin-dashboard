```

### 2. Detailed Phase Status

## Important Notes

- **This is a READ-ONLY command** - Do NOT make any changes
- Do NOT update MIGRATION_LOG.md
- Do NOT use TodoWrite
- Do NOT create or edit any files
- Just report the status based on MIGRATION_LOG.md

## Sub-Agent Guidance

**Do NOT use sub-agents for this command** - This is a simple status report based on MIGRATION_LOG.md.

## Output Format

Present the report in a clear, formatted way using markdown:
- Use headings (##, ###)
- Use bullet lists for tasks
- Use emoji status indicators (âœ… ðŸš§ â¬œ)
- Use code blocks for any code snippets or file paths
- Use bold for emphasis on important points
- Use tables if helpful for comparing phases

## After Presenting Report

Ask the user:
1. Do you want to continue with the next task?
2. Do you want to dive deeper into any specific phase or component?
3. Do you want to address any blockers?
4. Do you want to review a specific completed component?
5. Any other action?

Do NOT automatically proceed with any work - wait for user direction.
